# NBA Shooting Visualization
React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization

* Created a dashboard using React, D3 and Ant Design backed by API from stats.nba.com to visualize individual playerâ€™s shot data, including a shot chart and user profile view.
* Created 4 extra filters and 2 shot themes(hexbin and scatter) to provide more customized visualization on the shot chart.
* Developed an autocomplete player search bar providing a list of players(image and name) in the suggestion list.
